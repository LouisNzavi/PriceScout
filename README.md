# PriceScout
store product checker 
PriceScout is a consumer web app that tracks weekly price movements across major UK supermarkets and
shows the cheapest store per item and basket, with transparent unit pricing and loyalty toggle support. The
MVP focuses on Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Asda, expanding to Morrisons and Aldi after launch. It blends
first-party scraping with trusted third■party data collectors for speed, then migrates to in■house pipelines.
